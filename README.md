# nrfutilProductionGen
A Win Form software for generate all production files based on Nordic nrfutil.


To use this software you need to install [Nordic nRF Command Line Tools](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Development-Tools/nRF-Command-Line-Tools/Download#infotabs).
You will also need to download the SoftDevice and put it to the same folder to the execuable file.(I'm using [s132_nrf52_7.0.1](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Software/S132). `If you are about to use another version SoftDevice, you need to change the string in FormMain.cs, line29.`) 

Let me know if you need help or I made any mistake. I appreciate.
